<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is John Reyvi Gravidez. I'm 23 years old and currently a graduating Computer Science student at the University of the Cordilleras. I love exploring tech, coding cool stuff, and constantly learning new things. Whether it’s building websites, working on AI projects, or just tinkering with code, I enjoy turning ideas into reality.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me enjoying music, playing games, or diving into the latest tech trends. I’m looking forward to growing as a developer and contributing to awesome projects in the future!</p>

<p>Let's build something great together!</p>
